                <p id="text1">Coat or Hat? is a fresh look at the weather forecast. Often people only check the weather in order to work out what to wear before they head outside. Coat or Hat? takes a playful and direct approach to this interaction by allowing users to view humanised data instead of scientific. Rather than trying to translate degrees into layers of clothing users can see a visual of what to wear. This will be in the form of three interactions on the mobile friendly website and companion app for those who prefer not go through a browser on their mobile device.</p>

                <p>This makes the mobile service especially useful to travellers wanting to check out what to wear when they arrive at their destination. Coat or Hat? also offers opportunities for local businesses to advertise their products relevant to what users are wearing on the day. For example a travelling arriving at their destination may see that most people in the area are wearing beanies and nearby shops selling beanies can be suggested.</p>

                <p>The user enters their outfit by using a friendly draggable slider to add on layers and layers of clothing. This scale corresponds to temperature data and therefore can be translated into an emotive collection of the relative degrees people feel it is outside. Also there will be option for the user to select a raincoat and other specific weather related accessories.</p>

Also needed will be a geolocation API so that the user can be shown other entries relevant to their location and so that the data they submit will have a location logged. To construct the website a framework and plugins would also be used as well as a database to store accounts and other information.</p>

            <p class="cell-content">Skeleton is a framework which I tested to make this concept article and found it satifactory. It's simple column system stacks well for mobile and does not have the styling of bootstrap which will make the unique aesthetic of the new website easy to do. <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton Website</a></p>
            <p class="cell-content">App:</p>
            <p class="cell-content">The app will be very similar to the website except with additional functions specific to the mobile device.</p>
            <p class="cell-content">Notifications can be used to advise the user what others are wearing, to remind them to check what to wear or to remind them to enter their own outfit. They can also be used for the travel aspect to notify the user that they may need to change their outfit upon nearing their destination.</p>
